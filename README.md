# Memory-Box

This presents the code for a 3d earth with geolocation of memories. Developed for my brother's wedding. 

The programme uses three.js to build 3d visualisation. Due to the utilisation of images within webgl framework, the earth.html file has to be open in a live serveur to enable the use of images. 

The programme also enables geolocalisation of coordinates on a sphere. To illustrate this, a identification of Geneva is made. 

The programme also enables interaction with the 3D shapes. When the user moves its mouse on the dot in geneva, mouse over and mouse click option are available. 

Finally, the programme also uses .json data to store geolocalised data and images related to places. When users click on the dot in Geneva they can display three images from the city.
